      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I am a <span class="red">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Sheet Metal Worker<span class="red">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> turned
        <span class="green">&lt;select&gt;</span>Front-End Developer<span class="green">&lt;/select&gt;</span>,
        interested
        in all things computer programming related.

        For over a decade I have been working in the field of construction, installing HVAC systems in the commercial
        sector. My love of being able to take raw materials and transform them into something greater than the sum of
        its parts is what first attracted me to the field. It is also what has drawn me to coding.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the very first <span class="black">&gt; Hello World</span> and <span class="green">javaScript</span><span
          class="red">(</span><span class="orange">algorithm</span><span class="red">)</span>, I was hooked. Not only
        do I get to build amazing and beautiful things, but I get to continue using and strengthening my problem solving
        skills in a different environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The level of control and space available for creating in the digital world is virtually boundless and excites me more than I could have imagined. I look forward to seeing where this path will take me, and it will be nice to get to experience working on the receiving end of a well installed HVAC system. 
      </p>

      <p>
        This was my first JavaScript heavy project. I worked on it slowly as I learned JavaScript and would implement
        the new concepts I was learning to complete the functions of the buttons. Throughout the process I honed in my
        problem solving skills by learning how to break up the bigger parts of the logic into smaller pieces.

      <h4>Website clone/Resume</h4>
      <p>
        I built this website clone as part of my application to a local software company. While replicating the layout
        of the site, I replaced the original content, (info about the company) with information about myself, acting as
        a sort of interactive resume. When I discovered this company, I really felt attracted to their values. I wanted
        to make something for them that expressed how much I desired to work there.
